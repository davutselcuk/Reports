# Overview

In this report, we will focus on the SCADA/ICS protocol, which helps maintain efficiency, process data for smarter decisions, and communicate system issues to help reduce downtime.<br>

This Report provides:

* Mitigation details for a vulnerability affecting working status of PLC.
* Disclosure of exploit runs on ModBus protocol.
* Simulating an attack scenario against Scada Honeypot (Conpot)
* Writing IDS rules to detect attack

# Vulnerability Overview

#### Improper Input Validation

This module abuses a buffer overflow vulnerability to trigger a Denial of Service of the BKCLogSvr component in the Yokogaca CENTUM CS 3000 product.


For this, this module is a kind of Dos attack that sends crafted UDP packets.<br>


#### Vulnerability Details
A vulnerability was found in Yokogawa CENTUM CS 3000 up to R3.07 and classified as very critical. This issue affects an unknown code of the file BKCLogSvr.exe.This module abuses a buffer overflow vulnerability to trigger a Denial of Service of the BKCLogSvr component in the Yokogaca CENTUM CS 3000 product. The vulnerability exists in the handling of malformed log packets, with an unexpected long level field.<br>

 The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of usage of uninitialized memory from the stack and a dangerous string copy.

##### Butter Overflow ?

Buffer overflow exploits are attacks that alter the flow of the application by overwriting parts of the memory. A buffer overflow is a common software flaw that results in an error. This error condition occurs when more data is written to a memory location than allocated. When memory overflows, neighboring memory regions are overwritten, causing errors or crashes. If not restricted, specially crafted input can cause a buffer overflow, causing many security issues.

When a buffer overflow corrupts the memory, the software crashes and can thus be used as an out-of-service attack.

##### _Explotability_

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

##### _Existence of Exploit_

Known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.


## Impact

Sending two consecutive packets is enough to trigger the overflow and cause DoS. However, if legit packets are processed by the server, there will be no overflow between the two malformed packets. Unfortunately there is no reliable way due to the use of UDP and lack of response.
<br>
The attack may be initiated remotely. No form of authentication is needed for a successful exploitation. Technical details of the vulnerability are known, but there is no available exploit.
<br> <br>
If the attack is successful, it may be recommended to replace the affected object with an alternative product.

# Exploitation of Vulnerability
As we mentioned before, with this exploit; attacker can cause a denial of service of the system.

In order to exploit the vulnerability we need to download [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)<br>

After downloading metasploit we can run it by typing;

```
# msfconsole
```

We can see the ModBus Frameworks' modules by typing;

```
# show all
```

```
# use /auxiliary/dos/scada/yokogawa_logsvr
```

```
# show options
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ics-scada/Reports/blob/main/yokogawa_logsvr/img2/show_options.png">
</p>

We have checked what parameters our exploit needs to run. This exploit needs;<br>

`RHOST` = remote host ip address,<br>
```
# set RHOSTS <ip>
```

After giving the parameters which are wanted we are ready to run it.

```
# run
```

<p align="center">

</p>

As you can see above, dos attack has started.

***

# Packet Analysing
Run wireshark while exploit weâ€™ve use running behind.
You see the blue part. This packet is the packet to the modbus protocol we want to analyze.

</p>


Double-clicking on the line opens the package contents. As seen above, we can see the destination ip address, source ip address and type in the Ethernet 2 line.

</p>

IP Header holds network layer information. Of these, it keeps all the details of the IPv4 protocol, which is considered the backbone of the OSI model. There is information on the internet protocol version 4 tab above.

</p>

And finally, as you can see above, we see the package content sent in the data line. A total of ten packages are sent. The package includes the area with the blue part and the first eight numbers there |00 04 00 00| and likewise |00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00| the content is fixed in all packages. Rules will be written according to this content used in rule writing.
