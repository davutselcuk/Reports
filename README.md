# In this repository, we organize attacks on our honeypot machine, which we have built on Google Cloud, with exploits created for scada systems. We are analyzing the attacks coming with our ubuntu machine that we have installed on the same network. If the rules are missing and no alarm is generated, we write the rule and add it to our rule file. At the same time, we monitor the network and perform packet analysis. Finally, we report these valuable studies.
